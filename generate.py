'''
NFTokenator - an easy-to-use, extensible, and customizable tool for generating NFTs.

Author: Max Eisen
Updated: April 6, 2022

Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or newer
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy
- 'traits.py' file with your defined traits, layers for each trait and each layer's weight in the form of:
  traitList = ["background", "body", "shirt"...]
  background = ["Black And White", "Green And Blue"]
  background_weights = [50, 50]... # must add up to 100
  NOTE: The only required trait is 'background' which will be used as the base for the token images.
- 'assets' folder with all the possible layers for each trait in the form of:
  assets > background > BlackAndWhite.png...
  NOTE: Folder and file names must match exactly with the 'traits' file, aside from spaces in trait option names, which will be removed.

Usage
1. Complete setup section (above)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python3 generate.py`
