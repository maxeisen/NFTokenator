# Assets Example Folder

## Explanation
This folder can be used as an example for the assets folder. Add subfolders for your own traits and your created layers (artwork) to those subfolders.  
**DO NOT** delete the `backgrounds` folder, as at least one background layer is required to generate the tokens.
