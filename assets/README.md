# Assets Example Folder

## Explanation
This folder can be used as an example for the assets folder. Add subfolders for your own traits and your created layers (artwork) to those subfolders.  
**DO NOT** delete the `background` folder, and make sure there is at least one background asset provided, as a background layer is required to generate the tokens.
